QUAKE 2: JustABox (Metal Gear Solid inspired) Mod


How to play:

You are Solid Snake, and your mission is to infiltrate this alien base. 
Stealth is your best friend on this mission. You're equipped with stealth
camouflage which can render you invisible to enemies as long as you don't
attack them. To activate, use "~" and then type "stealth".

You also are equipped with a signature cardboard box. In the event your
stealth camo fails you, this is a nice alternative. Simply use "~" and 
type "cBox". The cardboard box will remove any and all ammo though, as
you won't be able to attack while being hidden within it.

Luckily for you, you're also equipped with some weapons from the get go.

Your suppressed Socom pistol will be very useful for taking down enemies
silently. Use this as your main weapon as it will not attract enemies. 
However things may get hairy on your mission, so you've been given
some other, more powerful weapons...

The RGB6 grenade launcher is great for taking down large enemies. It
explodes upon impact so be careful where you're shooting it.

Next up, the Famas may not hold too much ammo, 25 bullets to be exact--
but it's a deadly weapon. The power is no slouch so be sure to
keep ammo handy for this assault rifle.

Finally, you have the Stinger missile launcher. This missile
launcher comes with a built in homing feature. You can use it
to lock on to and take out enemies from afar.

Be careful though, Snake. If you're spotted by the enemy,
they WILL call for backup. The entire base will go on
high alert and they'll bring out their best soldiers to
ensure you DON"T survive. So be sure to keep quiet
and make your way through the base undetected.
